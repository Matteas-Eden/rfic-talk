# Reducing Friction with Intentional Communication

This repo contains the slide deck for the talk I gave at the [Junior Dev Auckland Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/JuniorDev-Auckland/) on Wednesday, October 2nd, 2024.

The blurb for the talk:
> **Talk 1: Lessons I've Learnt in Reducing Friction: Why Intentional Communication Matters**
> 
> Over the past year, I've had a lot of opportunities to make an impact in various parts of my organisation. With each opportunity came a new set of lessons; ways that I messed up that I could learn from. I got a lot of feedback from lots of people, and the one thing I focused on which really turned everything around was my communication. By being more intentional with my communication, I earned people's trust, became more productive, and reduced a lot of friction that had surrounded my work. Now I'd like to share what I've learned so that we can all level up the way we communicate and work together.
